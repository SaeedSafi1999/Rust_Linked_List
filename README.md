# Welcome to easy_linked_list!
Hi! I'm saeed safi and worked as backend developer for 3 years.
I want to introduce some part of code that I managed for you to make work with arrays much easier.
**before start you should know:**
all functions return option type when you want to get value from them you should use :

    match  your_list_name.get_by_index(1) {
    Some(z) =>  println!("{:?}", z),
    None  =>  println!("not found"),
    }
   otherwise it returns something like this => some(value)
   we are trying to handle it in other version of the package in future.

# Functions
 - add => insert to list
 - last => return last element of list
 - first => return first element of list
 - get-index => return index of 
 - next => return next element in the list
 - is_last_index => return the value is last index in list or not
 - to_array => return simple rust array
 - get_by_index => return value by specific index 
 - remove_index => remove element by specific index
 - clear => remove all element from list

 if you have a suggestion you can comunicate with my email in my account
 thanks for your attention
